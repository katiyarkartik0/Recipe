## Backend Development

### Technologies

- **Node.js**: We've chosen Node.js as our backend runtime environment, allowing us to build a fast and scalable server.
- **Express.js**: Our backend is built using the Express.js framework, known for its ease of use and powerful features.
- **RESTful API**: We've implemented RESTful API endpoints to handle recipe search and user preferences, providing a simple and consistent way to interact with the server.
- **Third-party API Integration**: We've integrated with the Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to fetch recipe data based on user searches, ensuring access to a wide variety of recipes.
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and authenticate using Opaque Authentication Token (OAT) for a secure and convenient login process.
- **Database**: User data and preferences, such as saved recipes, hashed-password, are stored in a MongoDB database.

## Frontend Development

### Technologies

- **React.js**: Our frontend is built using React.js, offering a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **User-Friendly Design**: We've designed and implemented a user interface that enables users to search for recipes using keywords or filters, making the recipe discovery process effortless.
- **Recipe Display**: Search results are displayed with relevant recipe information, including title, image, and a summary, ensuring users can quickly find what they're looking for.
- **Recipe Details Page**: Users can explore detailed recipe information, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional data, all in one place.
- **Favorite Recipes**: Our application allows users to save their favorite recipes and view them later, creating a personalized recipe collection.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is responsive, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience across various devices.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: We've tested and optimized the application for cross-browser compatibility to reach as many users as possible.
