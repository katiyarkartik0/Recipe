### Overview

This is a React app is a modern and efficient web application built using cutting-edge technologies. It combines the power of React Router for routing and navigation, Redux Toolkit for state management. Additionally, it utilizes various React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, for enhanced functionality and performance.

### Features

This includes a wide range of features designed to provide an excellent user experience:

- **Routing and Navigation**: Utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between pages, enhancing the user experience.

- **State Management**: Employs Redux Toolkit, a powerful library for state management, to efficiently manage and update application state.

- **React Hooks**: Leverages various React hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, `useCallback`.

### Technologies Used

Your app relies on the following key technologies and libraries:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **React Router**: A routing library for handling navigation within your application.

- **Redux Toolkit**: A library for efficient state management in React applications.

- **React Hooks**: Essential React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, for building functional components.

### Getting Started

To get started with your React app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/katiyarkartik0/Recipe.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access your app.

### Folder Structure

Your app follows a well-organized folder structure to maintain code clarity and separation of concerns. Here's a brief overview:

- **src**: Contains your application's source code.
  - **api**: fetch requests to server api endpoints to obtain data responses.
  - **components**: Reusable React components.
  - **pages**: Top-level React components representing different pages.
  - **store**: Redux store configuration.
  - **utils**: Utility functions and helpers.
  - **App.js**: The main entry point of your app.
  - **index.js**: Entry point for rendering your app.
